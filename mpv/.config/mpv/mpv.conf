#Channels that your device supports
#"auto-safe" only sends channels that your active audio device can handle, which can cause issues for an ARC/eARC setup (uses TV instead of soundbar) 
#"auto" sends every channels as they're, which works for an eARC/ARC setup but also can cause issues if your sound device doesn't support certain channel setups

#Converts any audio with three or more channels to AC3 (for spdif support)
#This is useful if you use spdif or HDMI ARC (instead of eARC) to get multi channel support (5.1/7.1 PCM not possible)
#It also can be used in general for all audios (stereo support with "minch=2"), but this isn't recommended (lossy to lossy conversion reduces the audio quality).

#Won't work together with "video-sync=display-resample"
